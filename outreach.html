      <div class="team-text container-fluid"> <p>At Maji Kwa Watoto (MKW) Foundation, we actively engage with schools, orphanages, and centres across Kenya’s coastal region to provide life-changing access to safe drinking water. Institutions typically apply through an official letter or email, but we also receive referrals from community members who are familiar with MKW's work. Upon receiving an application or referral, MKW performs a needs analysis to assess the number of beneficiaries, the required water volume, and the availability of storage tanks. If a tank is missing, some institutions are unable to receive water, highlighting a significant area of need in our outreach efforts.
        Through partnerships with Dutch Water Ltd and local government agencies, MKW also provides education on hygiene, environmental care, and children’s rights, helping to build healthier communities. This outreach program is fully funded by our sponsors, Stichting Waterpas Foundation in the Netherlands.

<!-- <P>
  In 2006, two passionate Dutch entrepreneurs, Huibert Uittenbogaard and Peter Willem Hatenboer, visited Kenya. During their trip, they witnessed the severe scarcity of water in the Mombasa region and decided to establish a water factory in Mtwapa. Their goal was to provide the local population with healthy and clean drinking water. They were motivated by seeing firsthand the profound impact that the lack of clean water had on families' lives in this region. This initiative also aimed to create job opportunities for Kenyans who struggled to find employment due to a lack of education.

In 2009, further research was conducted to determine how this noble project could continue benefiting many, including future generations. The research revealed that there were numerous needy schools, orphanages, hospitals, and rescue centers in the area. Supplying healthy drinking water to these vulnerable groups would directly and indirectly improve living conditions now and in the future.

To make this possible, the entrepreneurs founded Stichting Waterpas in November 2009 to support their vision through funding. As part of their philanthropic efforts, Dutch Water began distributing free drinking water to schools, ensuring it reached the right people. In 2011, Dutch Water received funding for a 10,000-liter water truck from Wilde Ganzen, which significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of their distribution, allowing them to reach even the most remote institutions and serve many more.

As outreach expanded, the need for a dedicated non-profit entity became clear. On March 22, 2023, Maji Kwa Watoto Foundation (MKW) was officially registered as an independent organization. The purpose of separating MKW from Dutch Water was to strengthen its philanthropic mission, enabling it to fully dedicate itself to providing free water to schools, orphanages, healthcare centers, and rescue centers throughout the coastal region of Kenya.

With a renewed sense of purpose, MKW has increased its capacity to provide safe drinking water to more institutions along the coast, creating a positive cycle of improvement. Children enjoy better health, miss fewer school days due to illness, and demonstrate improved concentration in class. Access to clean water has provided a basic but essential foundation for growth and learning, leading to improved academic performance. Parents are now encouraged to send their children to school, knowing they will have access to clean water and a safer environment. This simple resource has become a motivator, bringing more children into classrooms, reducing dropout rates, and giving parents peace of mind.

Today, over 61 institutions benefit from MKW’s outreach, a testament to the vision of its founders and the dedicated support from Stichting Waterpas and other partners
