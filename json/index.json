            "description": "Our water foundation has helped 10 schools improve mid-term exam results by ensuring students have access to clean water. In the past, many children missed lessons due to stomach issues from unsafe water or leaving school at lunchtime to get water from home. Now, with a lunch program and clean water, students stay refreshed, healthy, and focused on their studies. Join us on December 1st at Amkeni Primary School for a special prize giving day to celebrate this success"
