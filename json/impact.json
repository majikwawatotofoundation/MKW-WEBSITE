          "content": "Since its founding, MKW has supplied over 8 million litres of purified drinking water to schools and community centres, benefiting more than 32,000 children across 55 institutions. Access to safe drinking water has transformed these schools by reducing absenteeism due to water-borne illnesses, creating healthier learning environments and fostering educational success. The journey hasn’t been without challenges; for instance, some deserving schools lack water storage tanks, limiting our reach. However, thanks to Stichting Waterpas and the Wild Geese Foundation’s support, MKW was able to overcome logistical obstacles with the acquisition of a specialized 10,000-liter truck, enabling us to transport water more effectively. MKW remains dedicated to expanding our impact, reaching new institutions, and overcoming challenges that stand between children and their right to clean water."
