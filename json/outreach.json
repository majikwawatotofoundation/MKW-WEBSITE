Institutions typically apply through an official letter or email, but we also receive referrals from community members who are familiar with MKW's work. Upon receiving an application or referral, MKW performs a needs analysis to assess the number of beneficiaries, the required water volume, and the availability of storage tanks. If a tank is missing, some institutions are unable to receive water, highlighting a significant area of need in our outreach efforts. Through partnerships with Dutch Water Ltd and local government agencies, MKW also provides education on hygiene, environmental care, and children’s rights, helping to build healthier communities. This outreach program is fully funded by our sponsors, Stichting Waterpas Foundation in the Netherlands."
